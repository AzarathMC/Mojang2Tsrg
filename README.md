# Mojang2Tsrg
A small tool that converts Mojang's ProGuard obfuscation map to TSRG format, for use by SpecialSource

It is currently under development, but is minimally functional. Providing the proguard .txt as the first argument,
and the output .tsrg as the second argument, it does exactly what it says.
